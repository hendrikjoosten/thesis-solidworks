# Summary

Update Notes at bottom (12/1016)

Flexible Ball & Socket Mount Set for use with standard GoPro style Mounts. Works with Xiaomi, GoPro, SJcam, and what ever else your using the gopro style mounting system with.

Prints fast / ok at .20mm 15%in fill with 2 shells and is sturdy but the actual joints will retain a better shape/hold, and the base mount will last longer if you USE 4 SHELLS.

You can pop together as many as you want to make a long flexible extension by duplicating/adding a couple extra Male/Female Ball Joint Sockets in with the print. (Separate .STL File for Male/Female Ball Joint Sockets Attached as well.

All Included in 1 .stl file:

1x Standard Male Ball Joint Socket Short Base Buckle (GoPro Mount Platform)
1x Male to Female Ball Joint Socket
1x Female Ball Joint Socket to 3 Fork Joint (GoPro Mount Platform)

Needs/Uses/Compatible With:

1x Standard M5 Acorn Nut (As found on GoPro Platform Mounts) The M5 acorn nut that can be purchased at any hardware store or you can buy a few here on amazon prime here for cheap http://amzn.to/2haU1Jw

1X M5x.8x* Screw (As included with GoPro Cameras)

Enjoy!

Update 12/10/16 Updated all files to repair mesh separation errors.I also made other mostly cosmetic changes.This design is a little more sound. Acorn nut bore is tight so that the nut stays in place with out the bolt. I install the nut in the bore using the screw first install any 2 fork end mount as if mounting the camera (so you don't break the ears), and use the screw to pull the nut into the bore.

# Post-Printing

## May Require Some Sanding / Filing

After print make sure no raft is left on the base mount bottom. I uses a flat file to rasp it level and free of any burs. Clean all contact points for burs with some emery cloth.

I use a cheezy cheap 3 piece hobofreight chain saw file set to clean the hole for the bolt. They prove a usefull tool in many other prints as well. 

Clean any burs from female ball joint ends with some emery cloth

Snap it all together and start filming!
